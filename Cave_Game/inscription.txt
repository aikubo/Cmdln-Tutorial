Welcome to the Cave. To escape the cave you will need to learn several words of power. 

	pwd 
	cd 
	ls
	grep
	mv 
	cp 
	mkdir 
	
If you need help you can always us the command "man pwd" and this will bring up the manual page for the pwd command. 

To escape you will need to first run this command 
 ./incantation.sh 

Use the ls command to see the pages it produces which will bring up your spell book. If you have an issue with permissions try the command " sudo chmod 775 incantation.sh" which will fix the permissions. You will have to have the root password to complete this command. 
Check "man chmod" to see what it does.
