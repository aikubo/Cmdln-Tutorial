Hello, welcome to the commandline tutorial hosted by the University of Oregon Women in High Performance Computing and [IgDEAS](https://igdeas.wordpress.com/)

You can download this using the github website by clicking the upper right corner where it says **Code** or by using the command: 

`git clone https://github.com/aikubo/Cmdln-Tutorial.git`

## Presentation
The presentation  with animations utilizes *Present* (Install Here)[https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present] and can be accessing by first installing *Present* then using the command 
`present cmd.md` within the directory where cmd.md is located. 

However a version of the presentation can also be found in cmd.ppx which is the powerpoint version without animations. 

## Game
This resposity also includes a Command line Game to test your skills. 
To play this game please open two terminal windows side-by-side in the SAME directory. In one of them run the game using `./foo.sh` in the directory you downloaded. 

In the other you will have to use various commands to progress in the game. 

If you wish to further test your skills, there is a second game called thief.sh you can run in the same way!
